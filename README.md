# Obsidian Custom Note Width
> A plugin for Obsidian.md that customizes the line width of individual notes. This is a forked repo from [@MugishoMp](https://github.com/MugishoMp)'s [Editor Width Slider](https://github.com/MugishoMp/obsidian-editor-width-slider) with the following improvements

| Before  | After | Impact
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
| Adjusts note margin  | Adjusts line width  | The note width only resizes when the window's width is smaller than the note's width|
| Need to manually set front matter property to store individual note width  | Changing the slider automatically saves the width to the note's front matter | No need to manually enter the note width again|

## Features
- Customize and save individual note's width with a slider in the status bar.
- Set the note's width to default by clicking the slider number. 

**Note! In order to change the note's width back to Obsidian default, reload the app after disabling the plugin.**
